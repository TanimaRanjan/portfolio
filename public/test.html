                        Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is
                         a powerful and effective therapy for the treatment 
                        of trauma. Symptoms of trauma can occur 
                        after an emotional or physical event that overtaxes our nervous system, 
                        causing high levels of distress. Left untreated, trauma can manifest in 
                        symptoms such as depression, anxiety, addictive behaviors, 
                        creativity blocks, and relationship difficulties.</p>
                        <b> </b>
                        <p class="emdr_paragraph">EMDR is an integrative approach that provides healing from disturbing images, 
                            debilitating emotions, and restrictive beliefs by directly impacting the way 
                            the brain processes information. Similar to what occurs naturally during REM 
                            (rapid eye movement) sleep, EMDR activates the REM processing system in the brain 
                            to access memory networks and release the emotional charge associated with 
                            distressing thoughts and memories. Treatment consists of bilateral stimulation, 
                            through sound or touch, which activates alternate sides of the brain. 
                            This process allows for the release of distressing emotional experiences 
                            held in the body and mind.</p>
                        <b> </b>
                        <p class="emdr_paragraph">As EMDR treatment addresses the source of distress, 
                            it is extremely effective in treating even the most problematic issues in a 
                            relatively short amount of time, often resulting in fewer sessions than talk 
                            therapy. As a fully trained and certified EMDR therapist, I have used this 
                            technique to treat the psychological effects of both large and small-scale traumas. 
                            My expertise allows me to safely direct you through the entire process until
                            you are feeling less troubled and ultimately at peace.</p>
